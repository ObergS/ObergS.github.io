  <a href="Top Gear.html">Inspiration</a> Top Gear was a fantastic show before Jeremy got nerded on (fired) if you havn't seen the show you haven't seen any car show. Even before May came on it was solid, so anything after Clarkson came on any petrol-head
  would recommend. It's just 3 blokes blabbering on about cars and just with any show they have their own characters. Jeremy Clarkson is fat, Richard Hammond is short, and James May is a clot.
