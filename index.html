  <a href="Top Gear.html">Inspiration</a> Welcome to the 5Â£ version of Top Gear you can call me Rotus, that's the only introduction you're getting so you just deal. Let's just get into it yes? I'm kidding of course, you can't answer me. I know it
  seems
  like there are more important things now, political corruption, unrest in the middle east, Despacito 2, etc. But if I were to say something along the lines of, "Kia is making a 5 passenger VolksAudi and saying it will change how we think about the
  sedan."
  All of a sudden ISIS can wait. Now, Kia's Magnum Opus is called the Stinger and it looks like the love child between
  of
  a Volkswagen Bug and an Audi Quattro. I like it, you got bamboozled I know, you thought since I said it was an VolksAudi you thought I didn't like it, but it looks like a pretty good car. The interior reminds me of an old Rolls combining a family friendly, crash resistant look with an aestetic of luxury.
